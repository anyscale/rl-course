# Online course starter: Python

This is a starter repo based on the
[course framework](https://github.com/ines/spacy-course) I developed for my
[spaCy course](https://course.spacy.io). The front-end is powered by
[Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org/) and [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) and the
back-end code execution uses [Binder](https://mybinder.org) üíñ

Thanks to [@hfboyce](https://github.com/hfboyce) for contributing a super detailed guide on getting started with this course framework, adding exercises, slides and other content, and customizing the design. It also comes with a Dockerfile that takes care of the dependencies for you.

[‚û°Ô∏è **Read the documentation here**](https://ines.github.io/course-starter-python/) 


## ‚úÖ Quickstart

1. [Import](https://github.com/new/import) this repo, install it and make sure
   the app is running locally.
2. Customize the [`meta.json`](meta.json) and
   [`binder/requirements.txt`](binder/requirements.txt).
3. Build a [Binder](https://mybinder.org) from the `binder` branch of this repo.
4. Add content (chapters, exercises and slides) and optionally add separate
   content license.
5. Customize the UI theme in [`theme.sass`](theme.sass) and update images in
   [`static`](static) as needed.
6. Deploy the app, e.g. to [Netlify](https://netlify.com).

### Running the app

To start the local development server, install [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)
and then all other dependencies. This should serve up the app on
`localhost:8000`.

```bash
npm install -g gatsby-cli  # Install Gatsby globally
npm install                # Install dependencies
npm run dev                # Run the development server
```

## üé® Customization

The app separates its source and content ‚Äì so you usually shouldn't have to dig
into the JavaScript source to change things. The following points of
customization are available:

| Location                  | Description                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `meta.json`               | General config settings, title, description etc.       |
| `theme.sass`              | Color theme.                                           |
| `binder/requirements.txt` | Python requirements to install.                        |
| `chapters`                | The chapters, one Markdown file per chapter.           |
| `slides`                  | The slides, one Markdown file per slide deck.          |
| `static`                  | Static assets like images, will be copied to the root. |

### `meta.json`

The following meta settings are available. **Note that you have to re-start
Gatsby to see the changes if you're editing it while the server is running.**

| Setting              | Description                                                                                                                                |

### Static assets

All files added to `/static` will become available at the root of the deployed
site. So `/static/image.jpg` can be referenced in your course as `/image.jpg`.
The following assets need to be available and can be customized:

| File              | Description                                              |

| `profile.jpg`     | Photo or profile image.                                  |
| `social.jpg`      | Social image, displayed in Twitter and Facebook cards.   |
| `icon_check.svg`  | "Check" icon displayed on "Mark as completed" button.    |
| `icon_slides.svg` | Icon displayed in the corner of a slides exercise.       |

## ‚úèÔ∏è Content

### File formats

#### Chapters

Chapters are placed in [`/chapters`](/chapters) and are Markdown files
consisting of `<exercise>` components. They'll be turned into pages, e.g.
`/chapter1`. In their frontmatter block at the top of the file, they need to
specify `type: chapter`, as well as the following meta:

```yaml
---
title: The chapter title
description: The chapter description
prev: /chapter1 # exact path to previous chapter or null to not show a link
next: /chapter3 # exact path to next chapter or null to not show a link
id: 2 # unique identifier for chapter
type: chapter # important: this creates a standalone page from the chapter
---

```

#### Slides

Slides are placed in [`/slides`](/slides) and are markdown files consisting of
slide content, separated by `---`. They need to specify the following
frontmatter block at the top of the file:

```yaml
---
type: slides
---

```

The **first and last slide** use a special layout and will display the headline
in the center of the slide. **Speaker notes** (in this case, the script) can be
added at the end of a slide, prefixed by `Notes:`. They'll then be shown on the
right next to the slides. Here's an example slides file:

```markdown
---
type: slides
---

# Processing pipelines

Notes: This is a slide deck about processing pipelines.

---

# Next slide

- Some bullet points here
- And another bullet point

<img src="/image.jpg" alt="An image located in /static" />
```

opening/closing tags and the children. Otherwise, Markdown content may not
render correctly.

### Setting up Binder

The [`requirements.txt`](binder/requirements.txt) in the repository defines the
packages that are installed when building it with Binder. You can specify the
binder settings like repo, branch and kernel type in the `"juniper"` section of
the `meta.json`. I'd recommend running the very first build via the interface on
the [Binder website](https://mybinder.org), as this gives you a detailed build
log and feedback on whether everything worked as expected. Enter your repository
URL, click "launch" and wait for it to install the dependencies and build the
image.

![Binder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13643239/39412757-a518d416-4c21-11e8-9dad-8b4cc14737bc.png)

### Adding tests

To validate the code when the user hits "Submit", we're currently using a
slightly hacky trick. Since the Python code is sent back to the kernel as a
string, we can manipulate it and add tests ‚Äì for example, exercise
`exc_01_02_01.py` will be validated using `test_01_02_01.py` (if available). The
user code and test are combined using a string template. At the moment, the
`testTemplate` in the `meta.json` looks like this:

```
from wasabi import Printer
__msg__ = Printer()
__solution__ = """${solution}"""
${solution}

${test}
try:
    test()
except AssertionError as e:
    __msg__.fail(e)
```

If present, `${solution}` will be replaced with the string value of the
submitted user code. In this case, we're inserting it twice: once as a string so
we can check whether the submission includes something, and once as the code, so
we can actually run it and check the objects it creates. `${test}` is replaced
by the contents of the test file. It's also making
[`wasabi`](https://github.com/ines/wasabi)'s printer available as `__msg__`, so
we can easily print pretty messages in the tests. Finally, the `try`/`accept`
block checks if the test function raises an `AssertionError` and if so, displays
the error message. This also hides the full error traceback (which can easily
leak the correct answers).

A test file could then look like this:

```python
def test():
    assert "spacy.load" in __solution__, "Are you calling spacy.load?"
    assert nlp.meta["lang"] == "en", "Are you loading the correct model?"
    assert nlp.meta["name"] == "core_web_sm", "Are you loading the correct model?"
    assert "nlp(text)" in __solution__, "Are you processing the text correctly?"
    assert "print(doc.text)" in __solution__, "Are you printing the Doc's text?"

    __msg__.good(
        "Well done! Now that you've practiced loading models, let's look at "
        "some of their predictions."
    )
```

The string answer is available as `__solution__`, and the test also has access
to the solution code.
