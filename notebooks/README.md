The directories here contain the RL course modules. The course is divided into ~5 modules.
Each module contains its own README.md with the title and short description of the module.
Each module contains ~5 sections. A section is a collection of one slide deck followed by 1-4 practice questions.
The practice questions can be multiple choice or interactive coding exercises.
Each section lives in its own `.ipynb` file. 
Within one of these `.ipynb` files, 2nd level headings are used for the slide deck title and the practice questions.
Within the slide decks, and practice questions 4th level headings are used for each slide/question. 
If there are multiple Jupyter cells between headings, these cells are all part of the same slide.
This is useful if, for example, a slide contains a mix of text and code.
